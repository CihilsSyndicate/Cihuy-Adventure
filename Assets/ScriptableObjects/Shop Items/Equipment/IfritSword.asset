  itemDesc: According to legend, Ifrit's Sword was retrieved from within the fiery
    peak of the highest volcano by a hero named Valeria. The sword was granted by
    the fire spirit Ifrit itself as a reward for Valeria's bravery in facing the threat
    of a fire dragon that menaced her village. Since then, the sword has become a
    family heirloom of the Valeria lineage, only wielded by chosen warriors deemed
    worthy of harnessing its elemental power.
