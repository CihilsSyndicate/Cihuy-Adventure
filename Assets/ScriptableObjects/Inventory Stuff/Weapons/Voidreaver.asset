  itemDescription: Voidreaver, a legendary sword forged in the heart of a dying star,
    is said to hold the essence of a cosmic void within its obsidian blade. The weapon's
    enigmatic origin and its dark aura have earned it a reputation as a harbinger
    of chaos and destruction. Whispers of its power speak of the ability to tear open
    the fabric of reality, unleashing otherworldly forces upon its foes. Those who
    dare to wield the Voidreaver walk a fine line between salvation and damnation,
    for the sword's immense power can consume the soul of its master as easily as
    it devours its adversaries.
