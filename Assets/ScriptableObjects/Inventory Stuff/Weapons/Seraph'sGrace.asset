  itemDescription: Seraph's Grace is a celestial blade forged in the heart of a long-forgotten
    star, said to have been blessed by the benevolent seraphim themselves. Its ethereal,
    iridescent blade is known to channel divine energy, providing unparalleled protection
    to its wielder. Legends speak of a humble knight who, guided by visions of seraphic
    guardians, unearthed the sword from the depths of a hidden temple. With Seraph's
    Grace in hand, this knight became an unstoppable force against the forces of darkness,
    defending the realm and spreading hope wherever they went.
