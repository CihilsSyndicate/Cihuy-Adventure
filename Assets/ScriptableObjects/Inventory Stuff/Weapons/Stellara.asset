  itemDescription: In a time when gods mingled with mortals, Aetherion, the deity
    of wisdom, cherished a blade from his mother, Elara, the goddess of compassion.
    Forged from a fallen star's heart, the sword named "Stellara" gleamed with celestial
    engravings and an ethereal gem at its core, embodying Elara's boundless love and
    wisdom. Stellara radiated a divine aura, symbolizing the enduring bond between
    mother and son. Aetherion carried it always, a beacon of hope and a reminder that
    love transcended even the divine, uniting them in celestial battles and cosmic
    realms.
