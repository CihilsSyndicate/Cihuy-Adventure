  itemDescription: According to legend, Ifrit's Sword was retrieved from within the
    fiery peak of the highest volcano by a hero named Valeria. The sword was granted
    by the fire spirit Ifrit itself as a reward for Valeria's bravery in facing the
    threat of a fire dragon that menaced her village. Since then, the sword has become
    a family heirloom of the Valeria lineage, only wielded by chosen warriors deemed
    worthy of harnessing its elemental power.
