  itemDescription: The Molten Gazer is a captivating sword known for its unearthly
    appearance. Its blade, a fusion of ashen gray and fiery lava red, conceals a set
    of ominous, ever-watchful eyes at its core. The hilt bears intricate runes, said
    to hold the wisdom of ancient fire-wielders. When wielded, the sword emanates
    intense heat, yet chosen wielders are immune to its scorching touch.
